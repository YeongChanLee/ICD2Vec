# ICD2Vec: Mathematical representation of diseases

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes represent the global standard for reporting disease conditions. The current ICD codes are hierarchically structured and only connote partial relationships among diseases. Therefore, it is important to represent the ICD codes as mathematical vectors to indicate the complex relationships across diseases. Here, we proposed a framework denoted _ICD2Vec_ for providing mathematical representations of diseases by encoding corresponding information.
