The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes represent the global standard for reporting disease conditions. The current ICD codes are hierarchically structured and only connote partial relationships among diseases. Therefore, it is important to represent the ICD codes as mathematical vectors to indicate the complex relationships across diseases. Here, we proposed a framework denoted **_ICD2Vec_** for providing mathematical representations of diseases by encoding corresponding information. First, we presented the arithmetic and semantic relationships between diseases by mapping composite vectors for symptoms or diseases to the most similar ICD codes. Second, we confirmed the validity of ICD2Vec by comparing the biological relationships and cosine similarities among the vectorized ICD codes. Third, we proposed a new risk score derived from ICD2Vec, and demonstrated its potential clinical utility for coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes, dementia, and liver cancer, based on a large prospective cohort from the UK and large electronic medical records from a medical center in South Korea. In summary, ICD2Vec is applicable for diverse quantitative analyses using ICD codes in biomedical research.

## Main experiments

![Overview](https://github.com/YeongChanLee/ICD2Vec/blob/main/ICD2Vec/ICD2Vec_overview_abb.PNG)

## **1. Preparing data**
### Fasttext model (wiki)
- Download the pre-trained Fasttext model (Eng. version):<br />
[Download link (~15GB)](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/fasttext/vectors-wiki/wiki.en.zip). 

    `unzip wiki.en.zip`
    ```markdown
    1. wiki.en.vec (~6.2GB)
    2. wiki.en.bin (~8.0GB)
    ```

## **2. Crawling the ICD-10-CM data**
- Crawling the clinical information of the ICD-10-CM codes :<br />
Reference url: [icd10data.com](https://www.icd10data.com/). 

    `Rscript crawling_icd10data.R`

- Outcomes: <br />
(1) [icd_info4.csv](https://github.com/YeongChanLee/ICD2Vec/blob/main/crawling/icd_info4.csv)

    ```markdown
    wget https://github.com/YeongChanLee/ICD2Vec/blob/main/crawling/icd_info4.csv

    ```


## **3. ICD2Vec development**
- Generate ICD2Vec with this code:<br />

    `ICD2VEC.ipynb`

- Outcomes: <br />

    `ICD2Vec.pkl`

We provide splitted zip files for ICD2Vec pkl or csv. <br/>
The pkl file is identical with the csv file. <br/>
For example, ICD2Vec.csv contains ICD code (DIS_CODE) and 300 dimensional vectors (V1-V300). <br/>
Please download: <br/>
(1) [ICD2Vec.csv.zip](https://github.com/YeongChanLee/ICD2Vec/blob/main/ICD2Vec/ICD2Vec/ICD2Vec.csv.zip), (2) [ICD2Vec.csv.z01](https://github.com/YeongChanLee/ICD2Vec/blob/main/ICD2Vec/ICD2Vec/ICD2Vec.csv.z01) <br/>
(1) [ICD2Vec.pkl.zip](https://github.com/YeongChanLee/ICD2Vec/blob/main/ICD2Vec/ICD2Vec/ICD2Vec.pkl.zip), (2) [ICD2Vec.pkl.z01](https://github.com/YeongChanLee/ICD2Vec/blob/main/ICD2Vec/ICD2Vec/ICD2Vec.pkl.z01)

    ```markdown
    wget https://github.com/YeongChanLee/ICD2Vec/blob/main/ICD2Vec/ICD2Vec/ICD2Vec.pkl.zip
    wget https://github.com/YeongChanLee/ICD2Vec/blob/main/ICD2Vec/ICD2Vec/ICD2Vec.pkl.z01
    
    unzip ICD2Vec.pkl.zip
    â€» Please place it in the same directory and decompress it through the .zip format file.
    ```
    
## **4. Arthmetic operation with ICD2Vec**
- Analogical reasoning with ICD2Vec (Table 1 and Table 2)<br />
- See 'examples' directory

    ```markdown
    input: query_to_vec("Skin Itching")
    output: L29, R23, C44
    ```

## Additional experiments
- EDA for the vectorized ICD-10-CM codes
- See 'examples' directory

    `EDA.Rmd`
